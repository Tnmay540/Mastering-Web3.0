# SHA256 Nonce Finder

This program takes some data as string input and tries to find a positive number x such that when x is appended to the end of the string, the SHA256 hash of this new string is less than the target, which is
0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

## How to run
- Run the code
- Enter your input message when prompted
- Wait for the program to find a suitable nonce and print it
- The program will also print the time taken to find the nonce
